Main Ideas
Knowledge-Based Economy: The role of knowledge in today's economy has shifted, making it a crucial asset for organizational success and competitive advantage. Knowledge creation, transfer, and management are now seen as essential for the long-term success of firms.

Corporate Sustainability and Responsibility: Organizations are increasingly facing the need to reconcile economic, social, and environmental goals. This holistic approach to value creation aims to meet the needs of the present without compromising future generations' ability to meet their own needs.

Need Knowledge-Driven Organization (NKDO): This concept focuses on aligning organizational strategies with the needs of stakeholders. It integrates social, environmental, and economic concerns, making sustainability and responsibility actionable for practitioners.

Calls from Practice: There is a growing demand from the business community, especially in Europe and North America, for a more inclusive and sustainable form of capitalism that prioritizes stakeholder interests and aligns with societal values.

Research Design: The research combines theoretical insights and practical knowledge through literature reviews and expert interviews with top-level managers. This approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of how to implement sustainable and responsible business practices.

Example: Importance of Sustainable Knowledge Management
In the modern business landscape, sustainable knowledge management is crucial for long-term success. For instance, companies that effectively manage knowledge to address environmental concerns can achieve significant competitive advantages. According to a survey, 90% of executives believe that sustainability is important, but only 60% of companies have a strategy for it. Those that do, report higher profitability and brand loyalty.

Statistics
Sustainability Perception: A majority of respondents in the USA favor a more equitable form of capitalism, with companies prioritizing stakeholder interests (JUST-capital, 2019; CONE Porter Novelli, 2019).
Employee Loyalty: Companies that align their purposes with core values, especially for younger generations, witness higher loyalty (CONE Porter Novelli, 2019; Pirson et al., 2020).
By focusing on the needs of stakeholders and integrating sustainable practices, organizations can not only meet regulatory requirements but also enhance their brand image, operational efficiency, and market position.
